# Max Msp Twitch

## Installation
Install node dependencies by running:
```
npm install
```

## Setup
Create a new file called **.env** which will contain your Twitch credentials:
I found this [link](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc) for finding Twitch credentials.
```
TWITCH_USERNAME=<USERNAME>
TWITCH_PASSWORD=<PASSWORD>
TWITCH_CHANNEL=<CHANNEL_NAME>
```
After creating this file open the *twitch* max-patch and you're good to go.
